# Product: YouTube

## Summary

These experiments aim to enhance user satisfaction, increase platform retention, and convert free users into paying subscribers. Each test is grounded in user behavior signals and designed to balance platform goals with user empowerment and transparency.

## User Experience Narrative

My first experience with YouTube was watching an animated clip of a hippo dancing while a dog played guitar. That moment marked the beginning of my long-term engagement with the platform. Over the years, my usage evolved from casual entertainment to educational and interest-driven content like tutorials, astronomy, and programming. This shift reflects YouTube's versatility and the increasing importance of personalization in user experience.

- **Leading Indicator:** Click-through rate (CTR) on recommended videos with probability shown.
- **Lagging Indicator:** Increase in average watch time and engagement across sessions.

### Test Design

- **Control Group:** Users receive standard recommendations with no probability information.
- **Test Variants:**
